		"description": "The Copper Web API allows you to access and build your own applications that interact with Copper in more complex ways than the integrations we provide out of the box.\n\nThe Copper Developer API (\"Dev API\") provides a RESTful interface with JSON-formatted responses to access most Copper resources. We are continuously working on expanding our API functionality, so stay tuned!\n\nAuthentication\n===================\nThe Dev API uses a token based authentication. You have to include the token in the header of every request, along with the email address of the user who generated the token. Each Copper user can generate API keys and can have multiple valid tokens at the same time. Admins can see all user generated tokens.\n\nTo generate an API token, in the Copper web app go to System settings > API Keys and click the 'CREATE A KEY' button. Copper allows you to label each key for its unique purpose. You'll need to generate an API key to make an API Request.\n\nRequests\n========\n**Encryption**\n\nAll requests must be sent using HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher. Please make sure your developer tools support this version of TLS as older versions or SSL are not supported for security reasons.\n\n**Headers**\n\nAll Copper API calls must include the following headers to authenticate the request:\n\n|       Key        |            Value             |\n| ---------------- | ---------------------------- |\n| X-PW-AccessToken | _API Key_                    |\n| X-PW-Application | \"developer_api\"              |\n| X-PW-UserEmail   | _Email address of token owner_ |\n| Content-Type     | \"application/json\"           |\n\n**Body**\n\nFor PUT or POST requests (e.g. create, update, search), the request parameters must be provided as JSON in the request body.\n\n**Rate limits**\n\nAll API calls are limited to 180 requests every minute. Once either limit has been reached, calls will return and error with status code 429. This rate limit is evaluated on a rolling window basis.\n\nResponses\n=========\n\nResponses use the customary [HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes), with the most typical ones being:\n\n|          Code          |        Meaning        |\n| ---------------------- | --------------------- |\n| *Successful Responses* |                       |\n| 200                    | OK                    |\n| *Error Responses*      |                       |\n| 400                    | Bad Request           |\n| 401                    | Unauthorized          |\n| 429                    | Too many requests     |\n| 500                    | Internal Server Error |\n\nEach of the entities in the Dev API (Leads, People, etc.) has a '/search' endpoint. For requests sent to '/search' endpoints, the response header contains a field called 'X-PW-TOTAL'. This value represents an upper bound of the total number of records returned in the search query. It allows the developer to estimate roughly how long it would take to extract the data when the results are paginated (See Paginating Search Results section).\n\nSearch\n======================\n\n**Search by Phone Number**\n\nThere are two types of phone number search, fuzzy and partial. The difference is in the way the input is permuted prior to search. In general, fuzzy search returns more results, but partial search returns results that are closer to what the user entered. Let's illustrate from an example. Suppose the user enters \"408-555-1234\". In either search, non-numeric characters are stripped first.\n\nPartial Search: \"4085551234\" is searched in the database for all records that have phone numbers that end in \"4085551234\". This includes entities with phone numbers such as \"4085551234\", \"1-4085551234\", \"123-4085551234\", etc.\n\nFuzzy Search: \"4085551234\" is permuted first by stripping 1-6 digits from the beginning of the sequence. If the resulting sequence is less than 6 digits long, it is dropped from the search. In this case, the search string set is \"4085551234\", \"085551234\", \"85551234\", \"5551234\", \"551234\". Any records in the database where the phone number ends in the string set is returned. The query results form fuzzy match includes results from the partial search and many more ambiguous results. For example, records with phone number such as \"5105551234\" would also be returned.\n\nTo designate the type of phone number search, specify the \"match\" field when entering the phone number in the search request body. E.g.,\n\n{ \"phone_number\": { \"value\": \"5551234\", \"match\": \"partial\" } }\n\nMatch scheme is partial if the input string is 6 digits or fewer. For an input string 7 digits or more, the default behavior is fuzzy search if a match scheme is not specified.\n\nPaginating search results\n======================\n\nOur /search endpoints return multiple records per response. How many records are included in a single response (=page size) is determined by an optional search parameter called \"page_size\". The default value for \"page_size\" is 20, and its value can be set to any integer between 1 and 200. When the search criteria match more records than what fits on a single page then you have to paginate the search results using one of the following strategies in order to get all the records that match your search.\n\nStrategy 1: Calculate the number of pages\n---------------------------\n\nEvery response from a /search endpoint has a field in the response header called 'X-PW-TOTAL'. It shows an upper bound of the total number of records that match the search criteria.\n\n\nTo calculate the number of pages to cycle thru, divide the total number of records by the page size. For the sake of example, let's assume that the page size is 200 and the total number of records is 775. The number of pages is 775/200 = 3.875 which rounded up to the nearest integer gives us 4 pages.\n\n\nNow, to cycle thru the pages we need to set the \"page_number\" parameter in the request to 1 initially, and then send additional requests for the subsequent pages.\n\n\nThe request header will look like this:\n\n\n_For the first page_\n\n\n{\n\n...\n\n\"page_size\": 200,\n\n\"page_number\": 1\n\n...\n\n}\n\n\n_For the second page_\n\n{\n\n...\n\n\"page_size\": 200,\n\n\"page_number\": 2\n\n...\n\n}\n\nand so on.\n\nThis strategy has one caveat; if records are added/modified in the system between the time when the header field is evaluated and when the actual pages are requested then those records may be included or omitted in/from the results incorrectly.\n\nStrategy 2: Count the records on each page\n------------------\nIn this scenario, we send a search request and specify the first page, by setting \"page_number\" to 1. Then use a logic that performs the following evaluation on the response.\n\n\n1. Count the number of records in the response\n2. Check if the record count equals the page_size\n3. a. If the record is less than the page size then we are on the last page and we can stop paginating\n3. b. If the record count equals the page size then increase \"page_size\" by one, send another request and start over with this evaluation logic.\n\n\nUsing the same example as above, with a page size of 200 and 775 total records the evaluation would go down as follows\n\n_Page 1_\n\n{\n\n...\n\n\"page_size\": 200,\n\n\"page_number\": 1\n\n...\n\n}\n\nThe response will have 200 records which equals the page size, so let's continue requesting.\n\n_Page 2_\n\n{\n\n...\n\n\"page_size\": 200,\n\n\"page_number\": 2\n\n...\n\n}\n\nThe response will have 200 records which equals the page size, so let's continue requesting. The 3rd page will have identical results.\n\n_Page 4 (last page)_\n\n{\n\n...\n\n\"page_size\": 200,\n\n\"page_number\": 4\n\n...\n\n}\n\nThe response will have 175 records, which is LESS than the page size, which tells us we are on the last page and we can stop paginating.\n\nRemember to sort you search results!\n-------------------\nIt is highly recommended that you sort the results you get back from a /search endpoint. This ensures that records are returned in a consistent fashion across requests. One common sorting scenario is to sort records by the date they were last updated, in a descending order. For this sorting please add the following parameters to the search request:\n\n{\n\n...\n\n\"sort_by\": \"date_modified\",\n\n\"sort_direction\": \"desc\"\n\n...\n\n}\n\n\nBest practices\n==============\n**Date formats**\n\nDate formats are in Unix Timestamp format and values are set and returned as 10 digit long integers (For example {\"date_created\": 1483988828}). There are a few notable exceptions, however. The \"close_date\" on Opportunities, Task Due Dates and Reminder dates, and custom date fields use an ISO \"mm/dd/yyyy\" format for setting and returning date values.\n\n\n**The API respects Team Permissions**\n\nA user's access to records in Copper may be restricted by Team Permission settings. The Dev API respects team permissions. It is recommended to use the API credentials of an admin user when using the Dev API because Admins have unrestricted data access.\n\n**Create a Developer User**\n\nIf you use the Dev API to create records in Copper, it is advisable to create a separate (non-personal) user just for integration purposes. Generate API credentials for this user and use those for integration. This way records created thru the Dev API will be owned by this integration user and can be filtered accordingly.\n\n**Entity ID scopes**\n\nUnique identifiers are unique within the scope of a single resource type. For example, a given identifier for a Lead will never be assigned to a different Lead, but a different resource such as a Person could use the same identifier.\n\n**File Upload**\n\nCurrently, the Developer API does not allow for file uploads. There is a workaround available.\n\n1. Create a custom URL field.\n2. Upload your file to Google Drive.\n3. Push the created file link into your Copper custom URL field.\n\nEmbedded Apps\n===================\nEmbedded Integrations lets you easily display an integration you've built in the Copper web app. [Working with our SDK](https://docs.copper.com/pw-app-sdk/), you can create and embed your own app in Copper in just a few clicks. To join the beta, click [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1tEgGLqAeYQ2PFmkaiwGEBRNGcpDBrK7zKvd2XXtqoIw/viewform?edit_requested=true).\n\nFor more info on embedded apps, please go [here](https://support.copper.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001624708-Working-with-Embedded-Integrations-BETA-).\n\nAppendix\n============================\n**Categories**\n\nWhen creating or updating entities such as leads or people, there are fields where value and category can be specified. These fields include email, phone, social, and website. Below are the valid categories for each of these fields.\n\n|  Field    |  Categories                                                                                   |\n|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|  Email    |  work, personal, other                                                                        |\n|  Phone    |  mobile, work, home, other                                                                    |\n|  Social   |  linkedin, twitter, googleplus, facebook, youtube, quora, foursquare, klout, gravatar, other  |\n|  Website  |  work, personal, other                                                                        |\n\nGetting Support\n============================\nFor code samples, please visit [Code Samples](https://support.copper.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000816826-Code-samples-and-tips).\n\nFor API questions and support, please [Submit a request](https://support.prosperworks.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) or post your question in our [Developer Forum](https://support.prosperworks.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/201113143-ProsperWorks-API-Developer-Forum).",

This is particularly useful to avoid creating duplicate Leads.\n\n**Match Criteria**\n\nThe supported match criteria are:\n* Name\n* Email\n* Custom Fields\n\nTo match on a Custom Field, the corresponding Custom Field Definition must be available on Leads and included in filters. (These settings may be viewed and edited in the web application via System Settings -> Custom Fields.)\n\n**Match Outcomes**\n\nMatch outcomes are handled as follows:\n\n* If no matches are found, create a new Lead.\n* If exactly one match is found, update that Lead.\n* If more than one match is found, return a 422 response with the IDs of the matching Leads.\n* If more than 30 matches are found, return a 422 response without the IDs of the matching Leads."

When multiple ciriteria are provided records meeting ALL criteria will be returned (the filtering criteria have an 'AND' relationship).\n\nTo see examples of search request using the various parameters, click on the `Leads Search` dropdown on the right. Certain fields can be filtered by an empty value, i.e., filter records where the field is not specified. For Leads, these fields are: city, state, postal_code, tags, custom dropdown, custom multi-select fields. For an example of how this works, see `Search Leads by Empty Field`.

Some fields (e.g. assignee_ids) can also filter for an empty value by specifying -2 as the ID.\n\nTo change the number of records returned, change the \"page_size\" parameter.

								"description": "The /search endpoint provides the ability to list people and sort the results by certain parameters. When multiple ciriteria are provided records meeting ALL criteria will be returned (the filtering criteria have an 'AND' relationship).\n\nTo see examples of search request using the various parameters, click on the `People Search` dropdown on the right. Certain fields can be filtered by an empty value, i.e., filter records where the field is not specified. For Leads, these fields are: city, state, postal_code, tags, custom dropdown, custom multi-select fields. Some fields (e.g. assignee_ids) can also filter for an empty value by specifying -2 as the ID.\n\nTo change the number of records returned, change the \"page_size\" parameter. E.g., specify 200 for a page size of 200 records.\n\n|           Field           |    Type   |                                    Details                                     | Default    |\n| ------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |\n| page_number               | number    | The page number (starting with 1) that you would like to view.                 | 1          |\n| page_size                 | number    | The number of entries included in a page of results                            | 20         |\n| sort_by                   | string    | The field on which to sort the results (see footnote 1).                       | first_name |\n| sort_direction            | string    | The direction in which to sort the results.

When multiple ciriteria are provided records meeting ALL criteria will be returned (the filtering criteria have an 'AND' relationship).\n\nTo see examples of search request using the various parameters, click on the `People Search` dropdown on the right. Certain fields can be filtered by an empty value, i.e., filter records where the field is not specified. For Leads, these fields are: city, state, postal_code, tags, custom dropdown, custom multi-select fields.

						"description": "The /search endpoint provides the ability to list Companies and sort the results by certain parameters. When multiple ciriteria are provided records meeting ALL criteria will be returned (the filtering criteria have an 'AND' relationship).\n\nTo see examples of search request using the various parameters, click on the `Companies Search` dropdown on the right. Certain fields can be filtered by an empty value, i.e., filter records where the field is not specified. For Companies, these fields are: city, state, postal_code, tags, custom dropdown, custom multi-select fields. For an example of how this works, see `Search Companies by Empty Field`. Some fields (e.g. assignee_ids) can also filter for an empty value by specifying -2 as the ID.\n\nTo search by custom fields, see `Search Entity by Custom Field` under `Custom Fields` folder.\n\nTo change the number of records returned, change the \"page_size\" parameter. E.g., specify 200 for a page size of 200 records.\n\n|           Field           |    Type   |                                    Details                                       | Default       |\n| ------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |\n| page_number               | number    | The page number (starting with 1) that you would like to view.                   | 1             |\n| page_size                 | number    | The number of entries included in a page of results                              | 20            |\n| sort_by                   | string    | The field on which to sort the results (see footnote 1).                         | date_modified |\n| sort_direction            | string    | The direction in which to sort the results.

						"description": "The /search endpoint provides the ability to list records and sort the results by certain parameters. When multiple ciriteria are provided then records meeting ALL criteria will be returned (the filtering criteria have an 'AND' relationship).\n\nTo see examples of search request using the various parameters, click on the `Opportunities Search` dropdown on the right.Certain fields can be filtered by an empty value, i.e., filter records where the field is not specified. For Opportunities, these fields are: company_ids, tags, custom dropdown, custom multi-select fields. For an example of how this works, see `Search Opportunities by Empty Field`. Some fields (e.g. assignee_ids) can also filter for an empty value by specifying -2 as the ID.\n\nTo search by custom fields, see `Search Entity by Custom Field` under `Custom Fields` folder.\n\nTo change the number of records returned, change the \"page_size\" parameter. E.g., specify 200 for a page size of 200 records.\n\n|           Field           |    Type   |                                    Details                                                   | Default |\n| ------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |\n| page_number               | number    | The page number (starting with 1) that you would like to view.                               | 1       |\n| page_size                 | number    | The number of entries included in a page of results                                          | 20      |\n| sort_by                   | string    | The field on which to sort the results (see footnote 1).                                     | name    |\n| sort_direction            | string    | The direction in which to sort the results.

						"description": "The /search endpoint provides the ability to list records and sort the results by certain parameters. When multiple ciriteria are provided records meeting ALL criteria will be returned (the filtering criteria have an 'AND' relationship).\n\nTo see examples of search request using the various parameters, click on the `Projects Search` dropdown on the right. Certain fields can be filtered by an empty value, i.e., filter records where the field is not specified. For Projects, these fields are: tags, custom dropdown, custom multi-select fields. For an example of how this works, see `Search Project by Empty Field`. Some fields (e.g. assignee_ids) can also filter for an empty value by specifying -2 as the ID.\n\nTo search by custom fields, see `Search Entity by Custom Field` under `Custom Fields` folder.\n\nTo change the number of records returned, change the \"page_size\" parameter. E.g., specify 200 for a page size of 200 records.\n\n\n|           Field           |    Type   |                                    Details                                                   | Default |\n| ------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |\n| page_number               | number    | The page number (starting with 1) that you would like to view.                               | 1       |\n| page_size                 | number    | The number of entries included in a page of results                                          | 20      |\n| sort_by                   | string    | The field on which to sort the results (see footnote 1).                                     | name    |\n| sort_direction            | string    | The direction in which to sort the results.

Certain fields can be filtered by an empty value, i.e., filter records where the field is not specified. For Tasks, these fields are: company, opportunity, city, state, postal_code, tags, custom dropdown, custom multi-select fields.

The Activity Types Developer API allows you to retrieve the list of Activity Types associated with your Copper account. There are two categories of Activity Type.\n\n\nActivity Types with category \"user\" describe user-entered Activities. By default, Copper has three user-entered activity types: Notes, Phone Calls, and Meetings. Notes have a hard-coded ID of 0. Phone Calls and Meetings are assigned IDs when your Copper account is created. Users may also create Custom Activity Types through the Settings page. These will be assigned IDs when they are created.\n\n\nCustom Activity Types that have been removed from the list in the Settings page are not deleted from Copper, because they are necessary to correctly handle Activities of those types. These Activity Types are visible through the Developer API for Activity Types, and can be used for filtering Activity searches, but cannot be used to create new Activities.\n\n\nActivity Types with category \"system\" describe system-generated Activities. There are currently two system activities: \"Property Changed\" and \"Pipeline Stage Changed\". They have hard-coded IDs of 1 and 3 respectively.\n\n|        Field         |  Type   |                                                       Details                                                       |\n| -------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| id                   | number  | The id of the Activity Type.                                                                                        |\n| category             | string  | The category of the Activity Type.

For Leads, this would be the endpoint `/leads/search`.\n\nDropdown and Multi-Select Dropdown fields have the additional option of searching for records where dropdown and multi-select dropdown fields are empty. This can be accomplished by adding an additional field: { \"allow_empty\": true }. Searching by Multi-select dropdown also allows searching if any, all, or none of the dropdown options are to be searched. These options can be used together.\n\nExamples of searching for each of the searchable fields can be found under the dropdown menu on the right. Examples given are for `Leads` and can be easily interchanged with any other entity."

			"description": "Copper supports relating Leads, People, Companies, Opportunities, Projects and Tasks to each other. In the web and mobile applications, these relationships are typically shown in a \"Related Items\" sections. The Related Items API allows you to relate resources to each other, to view a resource's related items, and to remove relationships between resources.\n\nAll relationships are bidirectional, i.e. relating Resource A to Resource B is functionally equivalent to relating Resource B to Resource A. Relationships can only exist between certain types of entities, and additional restrictions may apply. The following are the allowed relationships between Copper resources:\n\n- Leads: Tasks\n- People: Companies (limit 1), Opportunities, Tasks, Projects\n- Companies: Opportunities, People, Tasks, Projects\n- Opportunities: Companies, People, Tasks, Projects\n- Projects: Companies, People, Opportunities, Tasks\n- Tasks: Companies, People, Opportunities, Leads, Projects (limit 1 total)\n\nThe request URLs for each of these operations are constructed as follows. To find all records related to an entity (e.g. leads), the API endpoint is:\n\nhttps://api.copper.com/developer_api/v1/leads/{{example_lead_id}}/related\n\nTo find all entities (e.g. tasks) related to a particular entity (e.g. leads), the API endpoint is:\n\nhttps://api.copper.com/developer_api/v1/leads/{{example_lead_id}}/related/tasks\n\nThe entities leads and tasks in the above examples can be replaced with any entity types that are related to each other (see above for the complete list).\n\n**Notes**\n\nRelated Items may be added or removed, but not modified. (To \"modify\" a Related Item, remove it and add a new one.)\n\n\nThe Related Items API uses Identifiers (as opposed to full objects) to uniquely identify related items.",

Excludes: new entity relationships, new Activity or any change in meta data\n- **Delete** = an existing record is removed\n\nEvents are available for the different entity types as follows.\n\n| Record Type | Create | Update | Delete | type  |\n| ----------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ----- |\n| Lead        | yes    | yes    | yes    | \"lead\"|\n| Person      | yes    | yes    | yes    | \"person\"|\n| Company     | yes    | yes    | yes    | \"company\" |\n| Opportunity | yes    | yes    | yes    | \"opportunity\"|\n| Project     | yes    | yes    | yes    | \"project\"|\n| Task        | yes    | yes    | yes    | \"task\"|\n| Activity    | yes    | yes    | yes    | \"activity_log\"|\n\nTechnical considerations\n-----\n**Subscription count**\n\nYou may have up to 100 active subscriptions per account.\n\n**Rate limits**\n\nThe number of notifications sent are bound by the following limits:\n- 600 notifications per minute per account\n- 1,800 notifications per account for every 10 minutes\n\n**Multi-event notifications**\n\nOur notifications always send an array with the IDs of the records involved. The array contains at least 1 ID and may contain up to 30 ID's in a single notification. If more than 30 records are affected then we send multiple notifications, each with up to 30 IDs. Each notification counts as a single request towards the rate limit, regardless of the number of IDs it contains.\n\n**Retries**\n\nOur notifications are fired not more than once per event, and we do not retry them, regardless of the status returned by the notification endpoint.\n\n**HTTPS only**\n\nFor security reasons only https:// endpoints are accepted for the notification URL.\n\nWebhook properties\n----\n\n|     Field      |    Type    |                           Details                           |\n| -------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| id             | Identifier | The unique ID of the subscription                           |\n| target         | String     | The URL where the notification will be sent                 |\n| type           | String     | The entity type on which the event occurs                   |\n| event          | String     | The type of event that triggers the notification \"new\",\"update\",\"delete\"            |\n| secret         | Hash       | (Optional) Hash that stores any information (e.g. for authentication) to pass to the webhook event, in the form { \"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\", ... } |\n| created_at     | Integer    | The date when the subscription was cretaed                  |\n",
